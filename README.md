## PORTFOLIO PROJECT for ALX SE Africa

## O-Vet Care Web Application

O-Vet Care as envisaged is an online Veterinary System that will be designed for pet owners to have a one-time system to give swift attention to their pets, online assistance to discuss concerns and as well give quick resolutions to petsâ€™ disturbing issues as reported by the pet owners.

From this project, users can get a feel of what the web application is all about by having a "Logged Out Experience" and the routes that can be assessed by the user or customer includes:

- The landing page
- The About page
- The contact page
- The services page

## DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

To develop this application, we have to state some tools that will be used for the software development:

- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- MySQL DBMS
- Bootstrap CSS library
- JQuery JavaScript library

First we will create a virtual environment where flask will be installed.

But we need to have Python and Virtual Environment installed

### Install virtual Environment

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install virtualenv -y
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .ovetcare
```

### Activating the virtual Environment

```shell
# on a unix based operating system
source .ovetcare/bin/activate
(.ovetcare) /home/nerd $

# on a windows based operating system
.ovetcare\Scripts\activate.bat
(.ovetcare) C:\Users\nerd>
```

### Deactivating a Virtual Environment

```shell
(.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ deactivate
```

## INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

We have the following dependencies saved in a file called requirements.txt:

- bcrypt==4.0.1
- click==8.0.4
- dataclasses==0.8
- dnspython==2.2.1
- email-validator==1.3.1
- Flask==2.0.3
- Flask-Bcrypt==1.0.1
- Flask-Login==0.5.0
- Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
- Flask-WTF==1.0.1

- importlib-metadata==4.8.3
- itsdangerous==2.0.1
- Jinja2==3.0.3
- MarkupSafe==2.0.1
- pkg_resources==0.0.0
- SQLAlchemy==1.4.49
- typing_extensions==4.1.1
- Werkzeug==2.0.3
- WTForms==3.0.0
- zipp==3.6.0

> this was achieved using
>
> ```shell
> (.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
> ```

To install all these requirements do the following:

- Activate the virtual environment

```shell
/home/nerd $ source .ovetcare/bin/activate

(.ovetcare) /home/nerd $
```

- Install the dependencies

```shell
(.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION

To run the O-Vet Care application using command line, do the following:

> ### Step One
>
>  ```shell
>  (.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ python app.py
> ```
>
> OR
>
>## Step Two
>
> ```shell
> (.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ FLASK_APP=app.py
> (.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ FLASK_DEBUG=1
> (.ovetcare) /home/nerd $ flask run
> ```
>
> Both will give  you the output:
>
> ```shell
> * Serving Flask app 'ovet_care' (lazy loading)
> * Environment: production
> WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
